I'll guide you through safely migrating your ERPNext database from UAT to Production. This is a critical operation, so we'll proceed with proper backups and verification steps.

## 🏰 The Great Database Migration Quest

### ⚔️ Pre-Migration Preparations (Critical!)

**1. Backup Your Production Database** 🛡️
```bash
# On Production server
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench
bench --site [your-production-site] backup --with-files
```

**2. Stop Production Services** 🚫
```bash
# On Production server
bench --site [your-production-site] set-maintenance-mode on
sudo supervisorctl stop all
```

**3. Create UAT Database Backup** 📦
```bash
# On UAT server
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench
bench --site [your-uat-site] backup --with-files
```

### 🏴‍☠️ The Migration Process

**4. Transfer Backup Files** 🚢
```bash
# From UAT server, copy backup files to Production
scp /home/frappe/frappe-bench/sites/[uat-site]/private/backups/* user@production-server:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/sites/[production-site]/private/backups/
```

**5. Restore Database on Production** ⚡
```bash
# On Production server
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench

# List available backups to get exact filename
ls -la sites/[production-site]/private/backups/

# Restore the database (replace with actual backup filename)
bench --site [production-site] restore [backup-filename.sql.gz] --with-public-files --with-private-files
```

### 🧙‍♀️ Post-Migration Verification

**6. Update Site Configuration** 🔧
```bash
# On Production server
bench --site [production-site] migrate
bench --site [production-site] clear-cache
bench --site [production-site] build
```

**7. Restart Services** 🚀
```bash
# On Production server
sudo supervisorctl start all
bench --site [production-site] set-maintenance-mode off
```

**8. Verification Spells** ✨
- Login to Production ERPNext
- Verify recent data from UAT is present
- Test critical workflows
- Check user permissions and access

### 🛡️ Safety Enchantments (Important Notes)

1. **Database Size**: Ensure Production server has enough disk space
2. **Downtime**: Plan for maintenance window as Production will be offline
3. **User Notification**: Inform users about the maintenance window
4. **DNS/SSL**: Verify domain and SSL certificates work after migration
5. **Custom Apps**: Ensure any custom apps are compatible between environments

### 🚨 Emergency Rollback Spell
If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Restore from Production backup created in step 1
bench --site [production-site] restore [production-backup-filename.sql.gz] --with-public-files --with-private-files
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or help you prepare for specific aspects of the migration? Also, do you have any custom apps or specific ERPNext version differences between UAT and Production that we should consider?
